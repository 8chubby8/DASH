# DASH — Changelog

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document records the development history of DASH version by version. For every version increment it captures what was implemented, what broke as a result, what was done to fix it, and what remains outstanding. It is the honest record of how DASH was actually built — including the mistakes, regressions, and lessons learned.

This document is read alongside roadmap.md. Roadmap.md is the plan. Changelog.md is the reality.

**A version number is not complete until a changelog entry exists for it.**

## Version History

## Version 1.4.6

**Status:** Complete — bench-verified on the Arduino Uno R4 (launch DASH with an installed module plugged in → the green card turns ACTIVE within a sweep, the Serial Monitor shows the DISCOVER → HELLO → ACTIVATE → ROGER rally; install a new module → it goes straight to ACTIVE; uninstall while active → DEACTIVATE → ROGER and the module's heartbeat stops). Fifth version of the 1.4.x Transport Layer era.

**Scope:** startup reconciliation — the version where installed modules stop being dormant records and come alive each session. DASH is the single source of truth (arduino.md §6): a module boots SILENT and must be told to wake every session. The new reconciliation desk does the telling — a persistent `DISCOVER` sweep, `ACTIVATE` with acknowledged retries, Active/Dormant state on Module Management, and `DEACTIVATE` on uninstall. The firmware needed nothing: all three reference sketches had carried the SILENT → ACTIVE state machine since 1.4.4.

**Design decisions taken this session (all with Roger, 2026-07-06):**
- **One DISCOVER — no separate reconnect message.** Roger's instinct was that DISCOVER was for install and reconnection deserved its own message. Rejected on architectural grounds: a broadcast "installed modules, reconnect" is impossible when modules persist nothing and don't know their own install state (§6) — the only question a module can ever answer is "who's there?". The install/reconnect distinction lives in DASH: the same `HELLO` is an install candidate to the discovery desk and a liveness report to the reconciliation desk. A per-id ping and an optional HELLO state field were considered and parked (recorded in arduino.md).
- **The DISCOVER button became SYNC.** With the sweep persistent, install candidates appear on Module Management when hardware is plugged in and age away when it stops answering — a dedicated install-discovery button is redundant. SYNC is §6's manual "check now": one press serving both install and reconnection by running the sweep immediately. This amends 1.4.2's "broadcasts only on the button press, never on a timer" — that rule was the placeholder until the sweep 1.4.2 explicitly reserved for 1.4.6 existed.
- **ACTIVATE is re-asserted every sweep, not only when DASH thinks a module is silent.** A brown-out-rebooted module (engine crank) answers `HELLO` identically to a healthy active one, so a fresh `ROGER` is the only proof of life; activate-only-when-dormant would leave a silently-rebooted module dead until DASH restarts — invisible on the wire for a LISTENER, which sends nothing at runtime. Roger challenged the redundant ACTIVATEs; the traffic was measured (~1% of a 115200 wire for ten modules, even including the future §4b activation dumps; the §4b heartbeat itself is ~7%) and he accepted the chatter over changing the HELLO contract. The state-field alternative is parked, backward-compatible, if it ever matters on a shared bus.
- **Uninstall deletes immediately and warns after, rather than blocking on confirmation.** §6's FORCE UNINSTALL wording supports two readings; the non-blocking one was chosen: the record is deleted at once (DASH forgetting *is* the uninstall), `DEACTIVATE` retries behind it, and only if no ack ever comes does a dialog raise §6's warning — disconnect or power-cycle the module. A module never heard from this session skips the wire entirely, exactly as 1.4.5 behaved.
- **Cadence numbers:** sweep every 5 s for the first 60 s (the Uno Q's ~20–30 s Linux boot is the design case), then every 30 s forever (crank-reset and hot-plug recovery); ack timeout 2 s × 3 attempts; absent after 75 s unheard (≈ two missed slow sweeps), which is also the discovered-card prune horizon. A transport coming up (boot, replug, permission grant) triggers an immediate sweep; the sweep holds off while an install handshake is in flight so a broadcast never interleaves a declaration run.

**Implemented:**
- `Reconciliation` (`com.dash.android.transport`) — the controller's third desk, and its first with a clock. Owns the persistent `DISCOVER` sweep (fast phase → slow forever-rate, `sync()` jumps the timer); `onHello` re-asserts `ACTIVATE` for installed ids; `onRoger` feeds monotonic per-command ack counters (a StateFlow condition-wait, so a fast ROGER can't be missed and a stale one can't satisfy a fresh command) — an activate ack is the only thing that turns a module ACTIVE; `uninstall` deletes immediately then hushes with retried `DEACTIVATE`; exposes `activity: StateFlow<Map<String, ModuleActivity>>` (ACTIVE/DORMANT) and `unconfirmedDeactivation` for the §6 warning.
- `Discovery` — the broadcast moved out (to the sweep); the desk became the passive HELLO collector: upsert by id, entries age out via `prune()` on the sweep's clock. The 1.4.2 clear-and-rebroadcast `discover()` method retired; the kdoc records the amendment.
- `ModuleDatabase` — gains `loaded: StateFlow<Boolean>` so the first sweep waits for the disk read and an early HELLO is matched against the real installed list, never a briefly-empty one.
- `DashController` — staffs the third desk: `HELLO` now routes to *two* desks (deliberately — each ignores the ids that aren't its business), `ROGER` to reconciliation; an install commit goes straight to `activate()` (the §7 flow ends `INSTALL_END` → save → `ACTIVATE`, so a fresh install lights up without waiting for a sweep); a transport reaching CONNECTED triggers `sync()`.
- `ModuleManagementScreen` — DISCOVER button renamed SYNC (calls `reconciliation.sync()`); installed cards wear a green ACTIVE / grey DORMANT chip; uninstall goes through the reconciliation desk; new unconfirmed-deactivation dialog with the §6 warning text; empty-state text now says plug it in and it appears.
- Version bumped: `versionName` 1.4.5 → 1.4.6, `versionCode` 9 → 10.

**Regressions:**
- None. The install handshake, progress bar, Details dialog, and database behave as in 1.4.5. The DISCOVER-button behaviour change (list no longer rebuilt per press; cards appear and age out on their own) is the agreed 1.4.6 design, not a regression.

**Fixes:**
- One compile-time fix during the build: `reconciliation` and `install` reference each other through lambdas (`installBusy` / commit-to-activate), which sent Kotlin's type inference recursive — explicit property types on both broke the cycle.

**Outstanding / deferred (with agreed homes):**
- **Absent-wired = fault vs absent-wireless = quiet dormant (§6)** — today absent is just DORMANT, neutrally; the transport-aware fault visual belongs to the later 1.4.x designed-failure work, alongside the install timeout.
- **A wedged install pauses the sweep indefinitely** — the sweep holds while any install session is open, and installs still have no timeout (deliberate 1.4.4 deferral). Inherits the same later failure work.
- **HELLO state field (`…|version|active/silent`) parked** — would let DASH activate only when needed instead of re-asserting; backward-compatible (no field ⇒ re-assert). Revisit if sweep chatter ever matters on a shared RS485 bus.
- **Simultaneous HELLO replies will collide on a true shared bus** — irrelevant on point-to-point USB, real on RS485 multi-drop; a reply-jitter scheme belongs with the multi-device work (1.4.10+).

**Notes:**
- Built and bench-verified in the session of 2026-07-06.
- New standing instruction from Roger, applied here and saved for future sessions: documentation updates must be **additive** — record what changed and why beside the original decision, never erase the previous version.

## Version 1.4.5

**Status:** Complete — verified (install a module, kill and relaunch DASH, the green card is back from disk; DETAILS reads the saved record; UNINSTALL removes it and its folder). Fourth version of the 1.4.x Transport Layer era.

**Scope:** the module database — the on-disk installed list that arduino.md §6 names as the single source of truth: DASH holds the installed list on disk and tells the module what to do each session; the module persists nothing. An install that completes now survives every restart. This is the last piece of *set up* before 1.4.6 makes modules *do* something — startup reconciliation reads this same list to decide who gets `ACTIVATE`d each boot.

**Design decisions taken this session:**
- **The database holds *installed*; the install desk holds *installing*.** The desk's `states` flow now covers only handshakes under way this session (the old `InstallState` sealed interface collapsed to a plain `Installing(progress)` — its `Installed` half moved to the database wholesale). A completed handshake is handed to a `commit` callback wired to the database, which persists it and owns it from then on. Asset payload bytes are held in the session for exactly that hop: validated in the desk, written to disk by the database, never kept in memory after.
- **Write order is the crash-safety mechanism.** One folder per module under `filesDir/modules/`: an `assets/` folder of raw block payloads, then `module.json` written *last*. A folder interrupted mid-write has no record and is skipped — and swept away — on the next load; a record and its assets are born and die together, so uninstall is one recursive delete.
- **One physical module = one card.** Module Management renders a merge of two sources keyed by id: the on-disk installed list (green cards, present the moment the screen opens — no DISCOVER needed, plugged in or not) and this session's discovered set (INSTALL cards for modules answering right now that aren't installed). A module in both is one green card — discovery just confirmed something DASH knew. DISCOVER still rebuilds the discovered set from scratch each press, but it can never remove an installed card.
- **Wire-supplied names never become filesystem paths unsanitised.** Module ids and asset names arrive off the wire and become folder/file names, so they pass through a plain-alphabet sanitiser (leading dots stripped, collisions suffixed, blanks given fallbacks) before touching disk. The sanitised asset filename is recorded in the new `InstalledAsset.file` field — the panel (1.6.x) reads the bytes from there.

**Implemented:**
- `ModuleDatabase` (`com.dash.android.transport`) — `load()` reads every `module.json` under `filesDir/modules/` at controller start (sweeping recordless debris folders); `commit(module, payloads)` assigns asset filenames, updates the `modules` flow synchronously (the UI sees it immediately), then writes assets-then-record on an IO scope; `uninstall(id)` drops the record and recursively deletes the folder. Exposes `modules: StateFlow<Map<String, InstalledModule>>` — THE installed list; absent here ⇒ not installed. JSON posture matches `DashPreferences`: `ignoreUnknownKeys`, so a record written by an older or newer DASH build still decodes.
- `InstalledModule` / `Subscription` / `InstalledAsset` marked `@Serializable`; `InstalledAsset` gains `file` (the on-disk filename). The record shape built in 1.4.4 serialised as-is — the "deliberately what 1.4.5 will serialise" bet paid off.
- `Install` — `install(id)` now also refuses an already-installed id (uninstall first); sessions accumulate raw payload bytes alongside asset metadata; `onInstallEnd` hands the finished record and payloads to `commit` and clears the session. `uninstall` left the desk entirely — it belongs to the database now.
- `DashController` — takes a `Context`, creates the database, calls `load()` on start, and wires the install desk's `isInstalled` / `commit` to it.
- `ModuleManagementScreen` — renders the merged one-card-per-module list (installed first, alphabetical; then this session's discoveries in answer order); DETAILS reads the on-disk record; UNINSTALL goes through the database; empty-state text now explains installed modules appear automatically.
- Version bumped: `versionName` 1.4.4 → 1.4.5, `versionCode` 8 → 9.

**Regressions:**
- None. The install handshake, progress bar, and Details dialog behave as in 1.4.4 — the change is that the result now outlives the session. Discovery and the Serial Monitor are untouched.

**Fixes:**
- None required.

**Outstanding / deferred (with agreed homes):**
- **A failed disk write degrades, not errors** — the record stays in memory (1.4.4's session-only behaviour) and the failure is logged. A designed failure surface remains part of the later 1.4.x failure work, alongside the install timeout.
- **Asset bytes on disk are read by nothing yet** — the module panel (1.6.x) is their consumer.
- **ACTIVATE / reconciliation → 1.4.6.** An installed module is still dormant; the database's `modules` flow is exactly what reconciliation will read.
- **Firmware-side, carried from the 2026-07-05 session:** the test LISTENER module (`arduino/test_listener/`) is written and compiling but awaits its bench run before commit.

**Notes:**
- Built in the session of 2026-07-05/06; verified by Roger and recorded 2026-07-06.

## Version 1.4.4

**Status:** Complete — bench-verified on the Arduino Uno R4 (Settings → MANAGE MODULES → DISCOVER → INSTALL → the pane runs a progress bar, turns green, and DETAILS shows the captured declarations). Third version of the 1.4.x Transport Layer era. Roadmap 1.4.3 was already merged into 1.4.2, so this is the next number.

**Scope note:** all three declaration parsers were built in one version — SYSTEM (`SYSTEM_SIGNAL`), LISTENER (`SUBSCRIBE`), and ACCESSORY (`MANIFEST` + asset `BLOCK`s) — rather than SYSTEM-only. The verify-on-hardware rule normally argues against building parsers with no module to exercise them, but Roger is writing LISTENER and ACCESSORY reference modules to flash onto the R4, so all three paths get real bytes before the version is signed off. The install handshake takes a module from *found* (1.4.2) to *set up*: DASH sends `INSTALL|id`, reads the type-specific declarations, and commits them on `INSTALL_END|id`.

**Design decisions taken this session (ahead of the features that use them):**
- **The install desk is the controller's first stateful and first bidirectional desk.** Discovery is fire-and-collect (each `HELLO` self-contained); an install is a *conversation* — opened by DASH sending `INSTALL`, fed by a run of declaration lines, closed by `INSTALL_END`. State lives in the desk (`Install`), not the controller, which stays a thin dispatcher — the patch-bay-not-a-funnel shape holding under its first real test. Sessions are keyed by module id in a map: the UI drives one install at a time, but the wire is id-addressed (arduino.md §2), so the frame supports many in flight for nothing.
- **Framing belongs to the transport; meaning belongs to the desk.** An asset `BLOCK|id|name|length|crc` is followed by exactly `length` raw bytes that may contain `\n` — so the reader must stop line-framing and read a byte count, then resume. This switch is made *synchronously inside the byte loop on the IO thread*: any asynchronous decision above the assembler would arrive after the payload had already been mis-framed as lines. The assembler does length-framing only (where does the unit end); the desk does CRC validation and record assembly (what the unit means).

**Implemented:**
- `Install` (`com.dash.android.transport`) — the install desk. `install(id)` opens an `InstallSession` (seeded from the module's discovery identity) and sends `INSTALL|id`; `onSignal` / `onSubscribe` / `onManifest` / `onBlock` feed the open session; `onInstallEnd` commits it to an `InstalledModule`; `uninstall(id)` drops the record. Exposes `states: StateFlow<Map<String, InstallState>>` for the UI. A declaration for an id with no open session is logged and ignored (well-mannered — also the forward-compat path for message types a later build will handle).
- `Inbound` (sealed: `Line` / `Block`) — one ordered stream carrying both ordinary lines and length-prefixed asset blocks, so `MANIFEST`, its `BLOCK`s, and `INSTALL_END` reach the desk in the order the module sent them.
- `FrameAssembler` — replaces `LineAssembler`. Frames two ways now: newline-delimited lines and length-prefixed blocks. On completing a `BLOCK|id|name|length|crc` header it switches to raw mode, reads exactly `length` bytes verbatim, and emits `Inbound.Block(header, bytes)`. A `reset()` (called on each connect) prevents a mid-block disconnect corrupting the next session's framing. Provisional 64 KB block cap guards a corrupt header (real asset-size caps are arduino.md §10, still open).
- `InstalledModule` / `Subscription` / `InstalledAsset` — the committed record, deliberately the shape 1.4.5 will serialise to disk. Identity fields (`type`/`name`/`description`/`version`) carry over from the `HELLO`; the handshake adds only the type-specific payload. `Subscription.parse()` captures all seven `SUBSCRIBE` fields (rate/threshold/gate included, though DASH does not act on them until 1.4.8).
- `DashController` now staffs two desks — routes `SYSTEM_SIGNAL` / `SUBSCRIBE` / `MANIFEST` / `INSTALL_END` to the install desk, and hands `Inbound.Block` payloads straight to it. `BLOCK` headers need no route branch (they ride inside `Inbound.Block`) but still appear on the wire tap.
- `TransportManager.inbound` is now `SharedFlow<Inbound>` (was `String`). Block payloads render on the wire tap as the header line plus a readable `«N bytes»` note — never raw binary in the monitor.
- `ModuleManagementScreen` — each discovered pane gains the install lifecycle: an **INSTALL** button → a progress bar (determinate for ACCESSORY once `MANIFEST` gives a byte total, indeterminate pulse for SYSTEM/LISTENER) → a **green pane** with a **DETAILS** button. The Details dialog (a settings-side modal — named a *dialog*, kept distinct from a v3 Overlay) shows the captured declarations type-shaped (signals / subscriptions / assets), with **UNINSTALL** and **DONE**. This dialog is the verification surface for the three parsers.
- Version bumped: `versionName` 1.4.2 → 1.4.4, `versionCode` 7 → 8.

**Protocol details settled this session (the module firmware must match):**
- **Asset `BLOCK` CRC is CRC32 as lowercase hexadecimal, no prefix** (DASH parses the field base-16; Arduino's `String(crc, HEX)` produces exactly this). A decimal CRC would fail every block and abort the install.
- **ACCESSORY variables and interactive controls are not implemented** — their install-declaration framing is an open item (arduino.md §10), so no format was invented. An ACCESSORY install carries `MANIFEST` + `BLOCK`s only until that framing is agreed.
- **`SUBSCRIBE` throttle/gate fields are captured and displayed but inert** until the stream engine (1.4.8).

**Regressions:**
- None. The `LineAssembler` → `FrameAssembler` rename and the `String` → `Inbound` inbound type are behaviour-preserving for ordinary lines (a line becomes `Inbound.Line`, routed exactly as before); the Serial Monitor is unchanged. Discovery is untouched. All install UI is additive.

**Fixes:**
- None required.

**Outstanding / deferred (with agreed homes):**
- **Install timeout + designed fail-state visual → later 1.4.x failure work.** 1.4.4 handles only the unavoidable failure: a block failing CRC/length aborts the session cleanly (record dropped, pane reverts to INSTALL, logged to logcat). A handshake that never sends `INSTALL_END` currently sits pending until relaunch — accepted on the bench, where the modules are under the tester's control.
- **ACCESSORY variables/controls declaration framing** — to be designed with Roger before that half of the panel contract (1.6.x) can land; arduino.md §10.
- **Disk persistence → 1.4.5.** Installed records are session-only; the record shape is ready to serialise.
- **ACTIVATE / live data / state store → 1.4.6+.** Installed means *dormant*: no module is sending yet.

**Notes:**
- Two SDK documents were extended this session as groundwork for 1.4.6+ (not 1.4.4 code): arduino.md **§4b State reporting** (SYSTEM modules dump all current values on `ACTIVATE` and heartbeat them every ~5 s; DASH does change detection) and **§5a Controller architecture** (the state store and the three signal behaviours — store+event / store-only / event-only — driven by `system_commands.md`, the new authoritative signal-vocabulary document). None of that is exercised until modules are activated and stream live data.
- Roger's design-conversation notes arrived using the retired term `SYSTEM_TX`; it was rendered as `BROADCAST` throughout (renamed 2026-06-25) and the substitution recorded in arduino.md's discussion notes. The `light_ambient` signal was also renamed to `ambient_light` for naming consistency.

## Version 1.4.2

**Status:** Complete — bench-verified on the Arduino Uno R4 (Settings → MANAGE MODULES → DISCOVER → the R4 appears in the list by name). Second version of the 1.4.x Transport Layer era.

**Scope note:** Roadmap 1.4.3 (HELLO response parsing) is merged into 1.4.2. As with 1.4.1 combining the transport and the monitor, the two are inseparable for verification: a Module Management screen with a DISCOVER button but a list that can never populate cannot be signed off as working. So the outbound broadcast and the inbound parsing were built together, and the first DISCOVER press produces a real module in the list.

**Two architectural decisions taken here, deliberately ahead of the features that will use them (future-readiness over the easy win):**
- **Discovery is a user-driven method of installation, not reconnection.** DASH broadcasts `DISCOVER` only when the user presses the button — never on a timer. It is the user's responsibility to ensure a module has booted first. The automatic low-rate re-sweep of *already-installed* modules described in arduino.md §6 is a separate mechanism belonging to reconnection / startup reconciliation (1.4.6). This refines arduino.md's model (which uses DISCOVER at boot for reconciliation too) — the manual install-time sweep and the automatic reconnect sweep are now distinct jobs. arduino.md itself is unchanged; the refinement is recorded here and revisited when 1.4.6 lands.
- **The message brain is a configurable crossroads, not a funnel.** A new `DashController` is the dispatcher: one inbox (the transport's inbound stream), sort by TYPE word, dispatch to the desk that owns that message type, one outbox. Today exactly one desk is staffed — `Discovery` (`HELLO`); every other TYPE word is ignored for now rather than mishandled (still visible on the wire tap), and adding its desk later is a single new branch in `route()`, never a rewrite. This is the frame for the future *configurable routing* discussed this session: standard signals act by sensible defaults, custom signals fall through to a user-defined desk, and a patch-bay override redirects a signal to Android, to DASH, or back out to another module (Roger's widening of the patch-bay idea beyond CAN to any module input). None of that routing is built now — but the shape here is what lets it plug in without rework.

**Implemented:**
- `DashController` (`com.dash.android.transport`) — the message brain / dispatcher. Owns its own coroutine scope; `start()` collects the transport's inbound stream and routes each line by TYPE word; `stop()` cancels. Created and owned in `MainScreen` alongside the `TransportManager`, living for the app's life via a `DisposableEffect` (started after / stopped before the transport). Holds the `discovery` desk.
- `Discovery` — the discovery desk. `discover()` clears the list and broadcasts `DISCOVER` (through `TransportManager.send`, so it shows on the wire tap like any line); `onHello(line)` parses a routed `HELLO` and upserts into an observable `modules: StateFlow<List<DiscoveredModule>>` by module id (a module answering twice appears once). The list is app-lifetime state — it survives closing and reopening the screen; only the next DISCOVER press clears it.
- `DiscoveredModule` + `parseHello()` — the seed of the `DashMessage` codec (flagged for 1.4.2 in the 1.4.1 outstanding notes). Parses `HELLO|id|type|name|description|version` (arduino.md §2: exactly six pipe-separated fields, one value per field, no embedded delimiters) into a typed value; anything malformed is rejected rather than guessed at, so a corrupt line never becomes a phantom module.
- `ModuleManagementScreen` (`com.dash.android.ui.modules`) — a full-screen instrument reached from settings, mirroring the Serial Monitor route. A left-aligned DISCOVER button (the first thing you do on the screen) and a live list of discovered modules rendered as cards (name, a colour-coded type chip for SYSTEM / ACCESSORY / LISTENER, description, id, version). Empty-state text guides the user to boot the module and press DISCOVER. The installed-module database (1.4.5) and per-module install/enable actions layer into this same screen later.
- `TransportManager` made genuinely transport-agnostic (roadmap's "all active transports"). Now holds a `List<DashTransport>` (just USB today; WiFi TCP joins it in 1.4.11 with nothing here to change) rather than a hardwired single transport. `send()` fans out to every *active* (CONNECTED) transport and records each on the wire tap; inbound lines from *all* transports are merged onto the wire tap tagged by origin; `status` aggregates across all transports, reporting the liveliest state present. A new `inbound: SharedFlow<String>` gives the controller a clean one-direction feed distinct from the observation-only `wire` tap (no replay, so a restarted collector never re-processes stale lines as new modules).
- `SettingsPanel` gains a MODULES section (`MANAGE MODULES →`, wired through a new `onOpenModules` callback exactly like `onOpenSerialMonitor`), placed above the Serial Monitor section. Becomes the Modules tab when the full settings tree is built in 1.5.x.
- `MainScreen` gains a `showModules` route and renders the `ModuleManagementScreen` overlay, mirroring the existing Serial Monitor overlay.
- Version bumped: `versionName` 1.4.1 → 1.4.2, `versionCode` 6 → 7.

**Refinements after first bench check:**
- The single-device status chip was removed from Module Management, and DISCOVER made always-pressable and left-aligned. Reason: DISCOVER broadcasts to *every* module on *every* active transport, so that screen is about the whole bus of modules, not any one device — a "device connected" prompt is the wrong mental model there. Device/connection state belongs to the Serial Monitor and to the Devices view coming in 1.4.10. The Serial Monitor keeps its status chip (honest while there is one device).

**Removed:**
- The DASH Scale section removed from the Settings panel. It has been parked with no active consumer since 1.3.2 (the scale multiplier was removed from bar height); the control changed a value nothing read. The `dashScale` preference, its persistence, and `LocalDashScale` are all untouched — only the dead UI control is gone. DASH Scale returns as a real control in a later version when there is more than one chrome element for it to scale uniformly.

**Regressions:**
- None. The transport-manager generalisation is behaviour-preserving with a single USB transport (the Serial Monitor behaves identically); the discovery brain, the Module Management screen, and the MODULES entry point are all additive; the DASH Scale removal touches only dead UI.

**Fixes:**
- None required.

**Outstanding / deferred (with agreed homes):**
- **Multi-device support & Devices view → 1.4.10** (just before WiFi TCP, which shifts to 1.4.11). Today the USB transport grabs only the *first* device it finds — DASH cannot see or address multiple physical devices. 1.4.10 adds that, a Devices view of what is physically connected, and device selection in the Serial Monitor (a dropdown). Roger's call to progress the module-lifecycle sequence first; not blocking, since install addresses a module by id and works with one device meanwhile.
- **USB one-time permission grant → 1.4.x cleanup before 1.5.x.** Currently Android re-prompts for USB permission on every replug (the runtime grant dies on detach). A `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` intent-filter + `device_filter.xml` (standard serial VIDs) turns that into a one-time "use by default" grant that survives replug and reboot. Android forbids zero-consent for a sideloaded app, so one-and-done is the floor on Bronze; it is silent anyway on the system-app production board. Deferred deliberately — understood, tolerable for now.
- **Standard system command vocabulary** — a formal list of known signals a module can send that the brain acts on by default (media keys, voice, volume, alongside the existing headlights/reverse). To be drafted in arduino.md "soon, carefully" — contract-level, so not rushed. Not started.
- Next feature: **1.4.4 — install handshake** (`INSTALL|id` → declarations → `INSTALL_END|id`), which takes the R4 from *found* to *set up*.

**Notes:**
- The controller reads the transport's `inbound` stream, not the `wire` tap, on purpose: the wire tap is a read-only observation surface (for the monitor and a future SDK logger element) and carries replay; the brain is the primary consumer and must not re-process replayed history as fresh discoveries.
- The two architectural decisions, the patch-bay/standard-vocabulary direction, and the "record only after verification" working rule are banked in project memory so future sessions inherit the reasoning rather than reconstructing it.

## Version 1.4.1

**Status:** Complete — bench-verified on real hardware (Arduino Uno R4). First version of the 1.4.x Transport Layer era.

**Scope note:** The ten-piece transport breakdown from roadmap 1.4.x is being built one piece per version (1.4.1 → 1.4.10). 1.4.1 deliberately combines the first two pieces — the transport interface and the USB serial transport — plus the Serial Monitor, because a transport foundation that cannot be seen working cannot be verified. Every later piece (discovery, handshake, routing…) is verified through the monitor built here.

**Wire format:** Built against the ratified module grammar in `arduino/arduino.md` (pipe-separated `TYPE|id|…`), not the superseded colon grammar still shown in `transport.md` (see the banner note added to `transport.md` on 2026-07-01).

**Implemented:**
- New `com.dash.android.transport` package. `DashTransport` — the pluggable transport abstraction (roadmap 1.4.1): a dumb pipe that moves whole UTF-8 lines in/out and knows nothing of their meaning, exposing `incoming: Flow<String>`, a `status: StateFlow<TransportStatus>`, and `start`/`send`/`stop`. This is the contract WiFi TCP and every future transport implement.
- `LineAssembler` — reassembles the inbound byte stream into complete lines, mirroring the firmware framing exactly (arduino.md §1): line ends at `\n`, stray `\r` tolerated and dropped, over-long lines discarded, bytes decoded as UTF-8 only once a full line has arrived so multi-byte chars split across reads survive.
- `UsbSerialTransport` on the usb-serial-for-android library. Fixed parameters 115200 8N1 (the known module profile — nothing to configure), DTR and RTS asserted on open (see Fixes). Auto-connects when a device is present via a low-rate re-sweep, requests USB permission on demand, and closes on detach. Absence of a device is a normal `NO_DEVICE` state, not a fault; denied permission and open failures degrade to `PERMISSION_REQUIRED`/`ERROR` without crashing — the capability-detection / graceful-degradation pattern. Falls back to treating an attached device as CDC-ACM when the built-in VID/PID table doesn't list it (covers Arduino boards not in the default prober set).
- `WireEvent` + `TransportManager` — the manager owns the transport(s) and exposes the read-only "wire tap" arduino.md calls for: a `SharedFlow<WireEvent>` of every line in/out, tagged and timestamped, with `replay = 200` so a newly-opened monitor immediately shows recent history. `send()` records the outbound line on the tap and forwards it to the transport.
- `SerialMonitorScreen` (`com.dash.android.ui.monitor`) — full-screen dev instrument reached from the settings panel, mirroring the system-bar edit-workspace route. Live scrolling log with direction arrows (→ out / ← in), timestamps, and TYPE-word colour-coding; PAUSE (freezes auto-scroll and capture) and CLEAR; a status chip reading the transport state; and a send box to type a line to the module (e.g. `DISCOVER` → watch `HELLO|…` return) before any handshake automation exists. It is a pure *view* onto the wire — it never owns the connection.
- `TransportManager` is created and owned in `MainScreen` (`start`/`stop` via `DisposableEffect`), so the connection persists for the life of the running app regardless of whether the monitor is open. `SettingsPanel` gains a SERIAL MONITOR section with an OPEN SERIAL MONITOR button, wired through a new `onOpenSerialMonitor` callback exactly like `onEnterEditMode`.
- Build plumbing: JitPack repository added to `settings.gradle.kts`; `usb-serial-for-android:3.9.0` and `kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.8.1` added to the version catalog and app dependencies; `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.host" android:required="false" />` added to the manifest (keeps DASH installable on non-OTG devices — the transport simply reports NO DEVICE). `versionName` corrected from a stale `1.3.5` to `1.4.1`, `versionCode` 5 → 6.

**Regressions:**
- None. The transport is additive and self-contained; existing screens are untouched except for the new settings section and the monitor overlay.

**Fixes (all found during bench testing against the Arduino Uno R4, and fixed before sign-off):**
- **No data received despite a CONNECTED status.** `DISCOVER` went out and the board — proven to reply via a Play Store serial monitor — stayed silent. Root cause: DTR and RTS were never asserted on the port. Many USB-CDC bridges (the R4 WiFi's on-board ESP32-S3 among them) gate data flow until the host raises those control lines, so the port opened but the wire stayed dead. Fixed by asserting `setDTR(true)`/`setRTS(true)` immediately after `setParameters`, wrapped in its own `runCatching` so a driver that doesn't support the lines still connects. This was the difference between DASH and the working terminal app, which asserts DTR by default.
- **Hot-plug never connected; permission was never requested.** Plugging the R4 in while DASH was already running did nothing, yet connecting *before* launch worked. Root cause: the hot-plug path depended on the `ACTION_USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` broadcast, which is unreliable for runtime-registered receivers, so DASH never noticed the device had arrived and never asked for permission. Fixed by not depending on that broadcast at all: a low-rate re-sweep (`RESWEEP_MS` = 1500) re-scans for a device whenever disconnected — which is exactly the "low-rate re-sweep" arduino.md §6 already specifies, so it also covers slow-booting modules. A per-device guard (`pendingPermissionDevice`) ensures permission is requested only once per device rather than on every sweep tick, and `connectFirstAvailable`/`closeConnection` are `@Synchronized` since the sweep and the USB broadcasts run on different threads. A denied permission is deliberately not re-prompted until the device is physically replugged.
- **Keyboard hid the Serial Monitor.** Tapping the send box panned the whole screen up and the log (and often the send box itself) disappeared behind the keyboard. Root cause: with edge-to-edge enabled the window pans rather than resizes for the IME. Fixed with `Modifier.imePadding()` on the monitor's root column so the `weight(1f)` log area shrinks and the send box lifts to sit just above the keyboard, plus `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` on the activity as a cross-OEM belt-and-braces.

**Outstanding:**
- `TransportManager` is tied to `MainScreen`'s composition lifetime; an activity recreation (e.g. rotation with auto-rotate on) recreates it and reconnects. Acceptable for a dev instrument; revisit if the transport needs Application/Service scope later.
- No protocol parsing yet by design — the monitor colour-codes by TYPE word for display only. The `DashMessage` codec and the discovery/handshake state machine begin in 1.4.2.

## Version 1.3.13

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Bar height stepper and element height stepper removed from the Settings panel and added to the edit-mode workspace in `MainScreen`, alongside the zone count control relocated there in 1.3.9. Both modify `editConfig` directly, so changes take effect immediately in the live bar — the user sees the result while still inside edit mode. Changes commit on SAVE or are discarded on CANCEL with the rest of the edit session. Height constraint logic preserved: when bar height decreases, element height auto-clamps to fit. Element height stepper shows "min"/"max" labels at the floor and ceiling as before
- Bar position toggle (TOP/BOTTOM) also relocated from the Settings panel into the edit workspace, sitting above the zone count control. Same deferred-commit behaviour — position change takes effect immediately in the live bar but is not persisted until SAVE. Settings panel SYSTEM BAR section now contains only EDIT BAR LAYOUT and RESET BAR LAYOUT
- RESET BAR LAYOUT relocated from Settings panel into the edit workspace. Resets zones and heights to factory defaults (position preserved). CANCEL discards the reset along with any other unsaved changes — no separate confirm dialog needed. Dead confirm dialog, its state variable, and the AlertDialog import removed from SettingsPanel
- Fixed: bar position toggle was not live during edit mode. Root cause: `activeConfig` was computed inside the bar Column, so the Column's alignment and TOP/BOTTOM branch both read `barConfig.position` (DataStore) rather than the in-progress `editConfig`. Fixed by hoisting `activeConfig` above the Column so all layout decisions reflect the current edit state immediately

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- None

---

## Version 1.3.12

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Element box drag bounds clamped in `EditRuler`. `currentXPx` is now constrained to `[0, rulerWidthPx - widthPx]` so neither edge can be dragged off the ruler. Previously `elementDragOffsetPx` was a raw unconstrained accumulator — a large enough leftward drag produced a negative `xPx` passed to `ElementBox`, which applied it as `Modifier.padding(start = xPx.toDp())`. Compose rejects negative padding and crashes. Right-edge clamping added at the same time for symmetry. The element now feels like it hits an invisible wall at both edges during drag. Drop logic reads `elementDragOffsetPx` directly and is unaffected by the visual clamp

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- Crash when element box dragged off the left screen edge

**Outstanding:**
- None

---

## Version 1.3.11

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Gesture events consumed unconditionally on every pointer event during drag (previously consumed only when `positionChanged()` returned true). This prevents gesture cancellation when the touch point moves outside the original bounds of the marker being dragged — the likely cause of unpredictable cancellation observed during testing
- Divider arrow pick-up confirmation: `isPressed` state set on DOWN and cleared on release; arrow alpha animates from 0.65 to 1.0 immediately on press, before any movement
- Element box pick-up confirmation: stroke width animates from 1dp to 2dp and alpha from 0.55 to 1.0 immediately on press, before any movement. The thickening stroke serves as the visual pick-up signal described in the 1.3.11 plan — no separate highlight treatment needed
- Ruler visual redesign: ruler background removed entirely — ruler area is now transparent, app content visible through it. A single 1dp horizontal centre track line drawn in barAccent2 at 35% alpha replaces the filled bar. Zone divider lines remain 1dp but now use barAccent2 at 30% alpha. Detent markers use barAccent2 at 40% alpha
- Element boxes redesigned from filled rounded rectangles to stroke-only outlines: 1dp stroke in barAccent2 at 55% alpha at rest, animating to 2dp at 100% alpha when dragging. Bound edge tints (red strips) remain as before, drawn as coloured rect overlays on the outline edges. `clip(RoundedCornerShape)` and `background` removed; replaced with `drawBehind` using `drawRoundRect` with `Stroke` style and `CornerRadius`
- New `barAccent2` theme token added to `DashColors` — default `Color(0xFF7878A0)`, a mid-tone blue-grey sitting between the invisible-dark `barAccent` and the content-bright `barText`. All ruler structural colours (track line, zone lines, detent markers, element box outlines, arrow resting state) read from this token. Independently themeable in version 2 with no component rework

**Regressions:**
- Element box drag and divider drag both broken on first build — boxes highlighted on press but could not be moved

**Fixes:**
- Root cause: `change.consume()` was called before reading `change.positionChange()`. In Compose, `positionChange()` returns `Offset.Zero` once a change has been consumed, so every drag frame reported zero delta and `onDrag` was never called with any movement. Fix: read `dx = change.positionChange().x` first, then call `change.consume()`. The intent of consuming all events (to prevent parent gesture interception) is preserved — just in the correct order

**Outstanding:**
- Element box dragged off the left screen edge crashes the app (negative padding). Captured as 1.3.12 — carries forward

**Notes:**
- The arrow alpha animation uses `spring(stiffness = Spring.StiffnessMedium)` consistent with the existing element box alpha animation — both feel immediate on press and return smoothly on release
- The ruler's transparent background means any colourful app content visible in the viewport will show through behind the ruler area during edit mode. This is intentional and looks clean in practice — the track line and outlines read clearly over typical dark automotive UI backgrounds. If a future theme has a very light or busy viewport background, adding an optional scrim to the ruler area is a straightforward addition via the theme token set
- `strokeWidthDp` in `ElementBox` is a Float from `animateFloatAsState` (in dp units); converted to pixels in `drawBehind` via `strokeWidthDp * density.density` where `density` is captured from `LocalDensity.current` in the composable scope

---

## Version 1.3.10

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Snap detents reintroduced at 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4 of bar width with a 4dp pull threshold. At 4dp, snap only activates when the divider is genuinely close to a detent — the pull zone is tight enough to feel assistive rather than obstructive
- Escape mechanic: if the divider is already settled at a snap point when picked up, it enters free-move immediately. Snap re-engages once the divider has moved more than 4dp from the touch-down position. This eliminates the on-touch-down locking that caused snap to be removed in 1.3.7
- Detent position markers: short vertical tick marks appear at each snap fraction on the ruler while a divider is being dragged; they fade in on drag start and fade out on release. Gives the user a visible target to aim at
- Divider arrow turns red (`0xFFE53935`) when settled at a snap point, derived from config on every recomposition so it updates in real time during drag
- Element box bound edge tinting: a 3dp red strip is drawn on whichever edge of each element box is bound — touching a zone boundary or packed against an adjacent element. Bound state is computed from anchor group membership (LEFT group: left edges always bound; RIGHT group: right edges always bound; CENTRE group: inner edges bound, outer edges free). Strip is clipped by the box's rounded corners
- Live edge highlight during element box drag: while dragging an element box, the relevant edge turns red in real time as a preview of where the element will land. If the dragging box is overlapping another element's footprint, the edge shown reflects the target's anchor (the anchor the dragging element will inherit on swap). If dragging in open space, the edge reflects the intended anchor from the thirds-based position (left third → left edge red, right third → right edge red, centre → neither)
- Element box swap on overlap: dropping an element box onto another element's footprint swaps their positions — the dragging element takes the target's slot (zone, index in list, anchor), the target takes the dragging element's old slot. Dropping into open space uses the existing thirds model and appends to the anchor group as before. This replaces the previous behaviour where moving an element anywhere near another element in the same anchor group would cause unintended displacement

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- N/A

**Outstanding:**
- Element box dragged off the left screen edge crashes the app (negative padding). Captured as 1.3.12

**Notes:**
- The snap threshold of 4dp is deliberately tight and may need adjustment after on-device testing. The consensus before implementation was to start tight and expand if needed — 6dp is the next step if 4dp disappears into the noise
- The escape mechanic uses `totalDragPx` (signed net displacement from touch-down) rather than total distance traveled. If the user reverses direction, accumulated displacement decreases — snap stays disabled until they have committed to a clear move away from the starting point
- `isSnapped` is derived from config via `remember(config, dividerIndex, rulerWidthPx)` rather than a separate state variable. Since config updates every drag frame via `onConfigChange`, the arrow colour updates in real time with no additional state management
- The element swap uses a content-moves-between-slots model: each slot retains its zone, index, and anchor; only the element `id` and `type` move. This preserves the structural integrity of the zone layout
- Ruler visuals (colours, sizes, overall aesthetic) are acknowledged placeholder — aesthetics are deferred; functionality is the priority for the 1.3.x edit mode sequence

---

## Version 1.3.9

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Zone count control (1/2/3 buttons) moved from the Settings panel into the edit workspace. Zone count is now part of the edit session — buttons update `editConfig` in memory, committed on SAVE or discarded on CANCEL
- `withZoneCount()` moved from a private extension function in `SettingsPanel.kt` to a method on `SystemBarConfig` in `SystemBarModel.kt`, where it belongs as a pure model transformation
- Zone distribution preset buttons (`DISTRIBUTION` row) removed entirely from Settings. The `ZoneDistribution` data class, both preset lists (`ZONE_DISTRIBUTIONS_2`, `ZONE_DISTRIBUTIONS_3`), `distributionActive()`, and `withDistribution()` are all deleted
- Edit workspace is now a `Column` — ZONES label and 1/2/3 buttons above, SAVE/CANCEL row below
- Settings System Bar section now contains only: position toggle, bar height stepper, element height stepper, EDIT BAR LAYOUT button, RESET button

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- N/A

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- **Zone count moved to edit workspace — deliberate design decision.** Previously, changing zone count wrote directly to DataStore with no way to undo. Moving it into the edit session means the user can experiment with zone count, see the result on the bar in real time, and commit or discard it alongside any divider positions they have changed. The edit session is the correct scope for all layout decisions
- **Distribution presets removed — deliberate design decision.** The preset buttons (`1:1`, `1:2`, `2:1`, etc.) existed to give the user a way to set zone widths before divider dragging existed. They predate 1.3.6/1.3.7. Now that the user can drag a divider to any position they want, the presets are redundant. Removing them simplifies the Settings panel and eliminates a UI element that was already superseded by a better mechanism

---

## Version 1.3.8

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- DONE button replaced with separate SAVE and CANCEL actions, centred in the screen while edit mode is active
- CANCEL discards all in-progress edits and exits edit mode with no DataStore write. `barConfig` (the DataStore-backed flow) is the implicit snapshot — it is never written until SAVE is pressed, so nulling `editConfig` restores the bar exactly to its last saved state
- SAVE commits the in-memory `editConfig` to DataStore then exits edit mode, identical to what DONE did
- Buttons are side by side in a `Row` centred on screen: CANCEL (grey, `0xFF424242`) on the left, SAVE (green, `0xFF2E7D32`) on the right. Both use the same monospace style as all other DASH text controls

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- N/A

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- The snapshot mechanism requires no additional state variable. `barConfig` comes from DataStore and is only written on SAVE — it is naturally the restore point for CANCEL
- Buttons are in the main content area (the empty space between bar/ruler and the opposite screen edge), consistent with the roadmap intent that the content area becomes the edit workspace. Additional controls move into this workspace in 1.3.9 (zone count) and 1.3.12 (height steppers)

---

## Version 1.3.7

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- `EditRuler` composable — a 44dp horizontal strip that appears on the bar's inner side when edit mode is active, separated from the bar by an 8dp gap. For a bottom-docked bar it sits above; for a top-docked bar it sits below. The ruler is the complete interaction surface for edit mode; the bar itself is never touched during editing
- Ruler entry/exit transitions — `AnimatedVisibility` with `expandVertically` (spring, medium bouncy) and `fadeIn`/`fadeOut`. The bar stays pinned to the screen edge; the ruler grows inward from the bar. Exit is a quick tween shrink in the same direction
- Divider arrow markers — each zone boundary in the ruler is represented by a filled triangle pointing back toward the bar, centred on an 80dp touch target. Drag is free — position follows touch exactly, clamped only to maintain a 48dp minimum width on each adjacent zone. `rememberUpdatedState` for stable gesture capture. The arrow sits atop a subtle 1dp vertical line that marks the zone boundary in the ruler
- Element footprint boxes — one box per element per zone, positioned to mirror each element's rendered position in the bar. `SystemBar` now fires `onElementMeasured(id, widthPx)` via `Modifier.onSizeChanged` on each element wrapper; `MainScreen` collects these into `elementWidths: Map<String, Int>`. The ruler's `computeElementPositions()` uses those widths and mirrors the Zone Layout's anchor-group packing (padding-aware, LEFT/CENTRE/RIGHT groups). Boxes are 32dp tall, rounded, `barAccent` fill at 40% opacity; dragging brightens them to 75% with a spring-animated alpha transition
- Element repositioning — dragging a box left or right moves it continuously; on release `computeNewConfig()` determines the target zone (which zone range the drop centre fell in) and infers a new anchor from the drop position within that zone (left third → LEFT, middle → CENTRE, right → RIGHT). The element is added to the end of the target zone's element list. The config update is immediate; the box reappears at its new natural position in the recomposed ruler
- `DraggableDivider` removed — the bar now renders plain 1dp dividers in all modes. The bar no longer knows about edit mode at all: `editMode` and `onConfigChange` parameters removed from `SystemBar`. Edit state is held entirely in `MainScreen` and driven through `EditRuler`
- 1.3.6 bar border/tint removed — the ruler's presence is the sole unambiguous signal that edit mode is active. No duplicate mode indicator

**Regressions:**
- Divider arrow markers were completely unresponsive to touch on first build

**Fixes:**
- **Hit area bug — `Modifier.offset` does not move the touch target.** `Modifier.offset { IntOffset(x, y) }` is a layout modifier that places the child at the offset position in the parent's coordinate system, but reports its own bounds as `(0, 0)` to `(childWidth, childHeight)` — the size of the child, not the size of the child plus the offset. Compose's hit testing descends the layout tree checking each node's reported bounds. When the touch point is at the drawn position (e.g. dividerX = 600dp) but the node's reported bounds only cover `(0, 0)` to `(40dp, 44dp)`, the hit test fails and the gesture handler is never reached. Fixed by replacing `Modifier.offset(x)` with `Modifier.padding(start = xDp)` throughout `EditRuler`. `padding` is also a layout modifier but it includes the padded space in the node's own reported bounds — a `padding(start = 580dp).width(40dp)` node correctly reports bounds of `(0, 0)` to `(620dp, 44dp)`, and the touch at 590dp passes the hit test and reaches the inner `pointerInput`
- Touch target enlarged from 40dp to 80dp after on-device testing confirmed that 40dp was registering but felt unreliable
- **Snapping removed.** Detent snap at 1/4 / 1/3 / 1/2 / 2/3 / 3/4 (carried over from 1.3.6's `DraggableDivider`) was rebuilt into the ruler but removed after on-device testing. With a 12dp snap threshold, the divider would lock to the nearest detent on touch-down, requiring the user to drag significantly before it registered any movement — indistinguishable in feel from the divider not responding. Snap may be reintroduced in a later version if there is a genuine case for it. For now drag is free

**Outstanding:**
- Element pick-up affordance (scale-up on press, before drag begins) → 1.3.11
- Drag gesture continuation if touch moves outside marker bounds → 1.3.11

**Notes:**
- `elementWidths` in `MainScreen` is populated by the bar's ongoing rendering — by the time the ruler first appears it is already fully populated. The `onSizeChanged` path fires only when measured widths change (element height change, config change), so there is no recomposition loop
- The `computeElementPositions()` function mirrors the Zone Layout's anchor-group math exactly, including the 8dp horizontal padding that the Layout applies to each zone. The ruler's footprint boxes will sit at the same X positions as the real elements in the bar
- `computeNewConfig()` infers anchor from drop position within the target zone (thirds model). This is intentionally simple for 1.3.7 — fine-grained reordering within an anchor group is a future refinement
- The `Column` wrapping bar + ruler in `MainScreen` is pinned to the same screen edge as the bar was previously. Because the Column is `BottomCenter`/`TopCenter`-aligned, the bar stays against the screen edge and the ruler expands inward as the Column grows — the DONE button's absolute position (against the same edge) continues to overlay the bar correctly
- The 1.3.10 roadmap entry references visual feedback when a divider is at a snap point. If snap is not reintroduced, that entry will need revising when 1.3.10 is reached

---

## Version 1.3.6

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Edit mode state — `editMode: Boolean` and `editConfig: SystemBarConfig?` hoisted in `MainScreen`. Edit mode is runtime-only, never persisted. `editConfig` is a live shadow of the bar config during editing; it is initialised from prefs when edit mode is entered and written back to DataStore only when DONE is tapped
- Entry point — "EDIT BAR LAYOUT" button added to the System Bar section of the settings panel. Tapping it closes settings and activates edit mode immediately. Placed in the System Bar section for now; will relocate to a dedicated Appearance section when the full settings tree is built in a later version
- Visual state change — the bar gains a 2dp border (barText at 35% opacity) when edit mode is active. Zone dividers thicken to 2dp at 60% opacity — visually distinct from the normal 1dp at 30% accent
- Draggable zone dividers — in edit mode each divider is replaced by a 16dp touch target containing the 2dp visual line. `pointerInput(Unit)` with `detectDragGestures` drives the drag; `rememberUpdatedState` ensures the gesture handler always reads the latest config without restarting mid-drag. Drag delta is converted to a zone fraction delta and applied to the two adjacent zones, keeping their combined fraction constant
- Detent snap — snap points at 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4 of bar width. Within 12dp of a snap point the divider pulls to it; drag past the threshold and it releases. All positions between snap points are valid — snap assists alignment, it does not constrain placement
- Minimum zone width — 48dp per zone. The clamp prevents either adjacent zone from collapsing below a usable size; fractions are adjusted conservatively so the combined fraction is always conserved
- DONE button — a green "DONE" button overlays the left end of the bar during edit mode (opposite the settings button, which is right-anchored by default). Tapping it saves `editConfig` to DataStore and exits edit mode. Config is written once on exit — not on every drag frame
- Settings button in edit mode — `DashAction.OpenSettings` is ignored while `editMode` is true. DONE is the only exit path

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Element drag-and-drop repositioning → 1.3.7

**Notes:**
- Edit mode was originally planned as a single version. It was split into 1.3.6 (infrastructure + zone divider dragging) and 1.3.7 (element drag-and-drop) because Compose drag-and-drop for production-quality element repositioning — ghost element, anchor snapping, snap guidelines, per-element sizing — is a substantial undertaking on its own. The split keeps each version completable cleanly and allows divider dragging to be tested and confirmed before element repositioning is layered on top
- `BoxWithConstraints` wraps the `SystemBar` Row to provide `barWidthPx` synchronously for drag fraction calculations. `barWidthPx` is passed to `DraggableDivider` via `rememberUpdatedState` so the gesture handler stays consistent if the bar is ever resized while edit mode is active
- The "EDIT BAR LAYOUT" entry point will move to a dedicated Appearance section of settings when the full settings tree is built. It is deliberately a simple callback — relocation will be trivial
- **Design revision — 1.3.7 onward:** The original plan for 1.3.7 (long-press-drag directly on the bar with ghost element and floating offset preview) was superseded by a design review before implementation began. The new model relocates all editing interaction to an adjacent ruler strip — the bar itself is never touched during editing. This is a substantially different approach to edit mode and replaces the direct-bar-drag model described in the 1.3.6 Outstanding section. The ruler model is now the plan of record from 1.3.7 onwards; the original approach has been retired without being built
- **Roadmap additions — 1.3.12 and 1.3.13:** Following a further design review, two additional versions have been added to the 1.3.x sequence. 1.3.12 relocates the bar height and element height steppers from the main Settings panel into the edit-mode workspace (alongside the zone count control moved in 1.3.9), with real-time resize feedback while inside edit mode. 1.3.13 removes height entirely from the DashElement API surface — the Zone Layout will impose a fixed-height constraint on each element's box before the element's own composable runs, making height an invisible platform concern rather than something element authors need to handle. Both changes are captured in roadmap.md; implementation follows once the preceding edit mode versions are complete
- **Roadmap revision — 1.3.13 updated, 1.3.14 added:** Following a further design review, the 1.3.13 entry has been substantially revised and a new 1.3.14 added. 1.3.13 now covers the complete element sizing contract: height invisible to element authors (imposed by DASH before element code runs), width derived from natural aspect ratio rather than negotiated by the element (proportional scaling like a photograph), rigid-by-default fit-or-no-fit behaviour using the existing zone overflow warning, and compressible elements documented as a future opt-in rather than part of this version. 1.3.14 is a new Spacer architecture correction: the 1.3.5 decision to handle Spacer outside the ElementRegistry is superseded — the Spacer is a standard rigid DashElement with no special layout handling, flexible gaps come from placing multiple instances rather than a variable-width single instance, and building the actual Spacer element is deferred to version 2 alongside Clock, Volume, and Now Playing. This entry explicitly corrects and supersedes the Spacer reasoning recorded in 1.3.5, so that the project history does not carry two contradictory decisions forward unreconciled

---

## Version 1.3.5

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Zone splitting: the user can split the system bar into 1, 2, or 3 zones via a zone count control in settings (ZONES: 1 / 2 / 3 buttons). Default state is one zone spanning the full width
- Zone width distribution: when 2 or 3 zones are active, preset distribution buttons appear (DISTRIBUTION). 2-zone presets: 1:1, 1:2, 2:1. 3-zone presets: 1:1:1, 1:2:1, 2:1:1, 1:1:2. The active preset is highlighted. Draggable dividers arrive with edit mode in 1.3.6
- Zone dividers: a 1dp vertical line is drawn between zones at 30% accent opacity. In 1.3.6 these become the draggable edit-mode handles
- Element packing layout: the `Zone` composable is rewritten as a custom Compose `Layout`. Elements are grouped by anchor (LEFT, CENTRE, RIGHT) and packed without overlap — LEFT group packs left-to-right from the left edge; RIGHT group packs left-to-right as a unit flush against the right edge; CENTRE group packs as a unit centred in the zone. All elements are centred vertically within the bar. This layout is the foundation 1.3.6 drag-and-drop builds on
- `ElementType.SPACER` added to the catalogue. `ElementPlacement` gains `spacerWidthDp: Int?` (null for all non-spacer types). Spacer constants added to `SystemBarConfig`: default 16dp, min 4dp, max 120dp, step 4dp. Spacer elements are rendered as invisible sized boxes by the Zone layout. No UI for placing spacers yet — that arrives with edit mode in 1.3.6
- Zone management on count reduction: elements in removed zones are migrated to zone 0 before the zone is dropped

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Drag-and-drop edit mode (element placement, zone divider dragging, snap guidelines) → 1.3.6

**Notes:**
- `withZoneCount()` and `withDistribution()` are private extension functions on `SystemBarConfig` inside `SettingsPanel.kt` — they are settings-panel concerns and don't need to live in the model
- The packing layout assumes measurables correspond 1:1 with `zone.elements` in list order — this invariant must be maintained when adding new element types. Each element type in the `when` branch must emit exactly one composable node
- Spacer is handled directly in the Zone Layout rather than registered in `ElementRegistry`. The registry is for content elements. Spacer is structural and carries no content or SDK surface
- Zone distribution fractions use float comparison with 0.01f tolerance for preset active-state detection

---

## Version 1.3.4

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Element height is now a user-controlled dp value stored in `SystemBarConfig.elementHeightDp` (default 36dp). Elements receive this as `scope.heightDp: Dp` in `ElementScope` and are responsible for rendering sensibly within it — the same contract an SDK element developer will receive
- `SizeVariant` enum removed entirely. It was a stepped abstraction over the thing users actually care about — a concrete size. The dp system is direct, consistent with the bar height control, and unambiguous for SDK element authors
- `ElementPlacement.variant` removed. Element height is global for now; per-element sizing arrives with edit mode in 1.3.6
- Settings panel System Bar section updated — bar height control labelled "SYSTEM BAR SIZE", element height control labelled "ELEMENT SIZE" below it, using the identical +/− stepper pattern
- Element size boundaries: minimum 24dp (label shows "min", − greyed), maximum one step below bar height (label shows "max", + greyed). When bar height is reduced below the element ceiling, element height is auto-clamped in the same save operation — config is always internally consistent
- `AlertsAreaElement` and `SettingsButtonElement` render proportionally to `scope.heightDp` — font and icon sizes scale as a fixed fraction of element height so the visual scales smoothly across the full range
- `SettingButton` composable gains an `enabled` parameter with distinct disabled colours — used for the element size steppers at their limits

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Zone splitting (up to three), inter-element snap packing, Spacer element → 1.3.5
- Drag-and-drop edit mode → 1.3.6

**Notes:**
- Element height proportions: `AlertsAreaElement` font at 30% of height, padding at 28%/11% horizontal/vertical. `SettingsButtonElement` icon at 55% of height. These feel right at the 36dp default and at both limits — adjust per on-device testing
- The `enabled = false` greyed state on `SettingButton` uses `disabledContainerColor = Color(0xFF1A1A1A)` and `disabledContentColor = Color(0xFF444444)` — visually distinct from the active and inactive states without being harsh
- **Departure from interface.md — element sizing model:** interface.md specifies element sizing as a percentage of bar height. This version implements a direct dp control instead. The dp model keeps bar height and element height as fully independent decisions, which is cleaner for the user and unambiguous for SDK element authors. interface.md should be updated to reflect this decision
- **Departure from interface.md — soft limit behaviour:** interface.md specifies amber soft limit warnings at the lower size boundary. This version instead shows a "min" label and greys the − button at 24dp, and a "max" label with greyed + button at the ceiling. The boundary is communicated through the control itself rather than a separate warning indicator. interface.md should be updated to reflect this decision

## Version 1.3.3

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Theme token system — `DashColors` data class carrying three named colour tokens: `barBackground`, `barAccent`, `barText`. Exposed via `LocalDashTheme`, a `compositionLocalOf` that any composable in the DASH tree can read without being wired through function parameters
- `DashColors.dark()` factory provides the default token set, carrying the colour values previously hardcoded across three files. Visually identical to 1.3.2 — the change is architectural only
- `MainScreen` provides `LocalDashTheme` at the top of the composition tree alongside the existing `LocalDashScale` provider. Version 2 introduces user-facing presets and theme switching by providing a different `DashColors` instance here — no component below changes
- `SystemBar` — hardcoded `BAR_COLOR` private val removed; bar background now reads `LocalDashTheme.current.barBackground`
- `AlertsAreaElement` — pill background reads `LocalDashTheme.current.barAccent`; ALERTS label reads `LocalDashTheme.current.barText.copy(alpha = 0.55f)`. Subdued text is a semantic derivation of `barText`, not a separate token
- `SettingsButtonElement` — gear icon reads `LocalDashTheme.current.barText`
- New file `ui/theme/DashTheme.kt` — `DashColors`, `LocalDashTheme`. Clean home for all theme infrastructure as the token set grows

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Element percentage-of-bar-height sizing, size variants (S/M/L), soft-limit amber warnings → 1.3.4
- Zone splitting (up to three), inter-element snap packing, Spacer element → 1.3.5
- Drag-and-drop edit mode → 1.3.6

**Notes:**
- `compositionLocalOf` chosen over `staticCompositionLocalOf` — the former only recomposes readers when the value changes, which is the correct behaviour for version 2 live theme switching. Static would recompose the entire subtree
- **How to add a token to the system:** (1) Add a field with a default value to `DashColors` in `ui/theme/DashTheme.kt` — e.g. `val barHighlight: Color = Color(0xFF4A4AFF)`. (2) Update `DashColors.dark()` (and any future preset factories) with a considered value. (3) Read it anywhere in the composition with `LocalDashTheme.current.barHighlight`. That is the entire change. No call sites break, no provider changes needed, no migration required for stored data

---

## Version 1.3.2

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Bar height is now controlled by the dp setting alone. `SystemBar` previously computed `barHeight = config.heightDp.dp * LocalDashScale.current`, meaning both the dp height control in System Bar settings and the DASH Scale +/- control affected bar size simultaneously. The scale multiplier has been removed — `barHeight = config.heightDp.dp`. The DASH Scale setting remains in the settings panel and its value is still persisted; it simply has no wired consumer at this stage
- Unused `LocalDashScale` import removed from `SystemBar.kt`

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- Two controls affecting bar height — the dp height setting and the DASH Scale multiplier were both acting on bar size. Removing the multiplier from bar height calculation resolves the conflict

**Outstanding:**
- Theme token system → 1.3.3
- Element percentage-of-bar-height sizing, size variants (S/M/L), soft-limit amber warnings → 1.3.4
- Zone splitting (up to three), inter-element snap packing, Spacer element → 1.3.5
- Drag-and-drop edit mode → 1.3.6

**Notes:**
- DASH Scale is intentionally parked rather than removed. It does not have a clear job while the bar is the only chrome element. It will be reintroduced as a multiplier across all chrome elements once there is more than one thing for it to scale uniformly
- The DASH Scale section remains visible in settings — it is not hidden or greyed out. Its persistence and the +/- controls still work; the value simply has no active consumer until it is properly wired back in a later version

---

## Version 1.3.1

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- System bar reworked from a placeholder coloured `Box` into a real, configurable, persistent interface element — `ui/systembar/SystemBar.kt`. Renders at top or bottom per config; height is the user-defined base (`SystemBarConfig.heightDp`) multiplied by the live DASH UI scale, so it stays consistent with the rest of DASH chrome
- Persisted data model — `ui/systembar/SystemBarModel.kt`. `@Serializable` `SystemBarConfig` → `ZoneConfig` → `ElementPlacement`, with `BarPosition`, `ElementType`, `ElementAnchor`, `SizeVariant`, `ElementKind` enums. Deliberately shaped now to hold the full 1.3.x feature set (multiple zones, per-element anchors and variants) so the stored format never needs migrating as later increments land. `SystemBarConfig.default()` guarantees the two mandatory elements are always present
- Persistence from the first commit — bar config stored as JSON in the existing DataStore via `kotlinx.serialization` (`Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true; encodeDefaults = true }`). `DashPreferences` gains `systemBarConfig` flow, `saveSystemBarConfig()`, and `resetSystemBar()`. Decode is wrapped in `runCatching` with a fallback to `default()`, so an absent, corrupt, or schema-changed config never crashes — it cleanly returns to default
- Two mandatory elements built — `AlertsAreaElement` (informational, placeholder visual until transport lands in 1.4.x) and `SettingsButtonElement` (interactive). The settings button enforces a hard 48dp minimum touch target via `Modifier.sizeIn`, regardless of bar height, exactly as interface.md mandates — the visible glyph may shrink, the touch area never does
- SDKable element framework — `DashElement` interface, `ElementScope`, `DashAction`, and `ElementRegistry`. Built-in elements receive nothing a community element could not; this is the seed of the v3 Element SDK. Interactive elements reach the platform only through the narrow `DashAction` channel (currently just `OpenSettings`)
- Settings relocated behind the settings button — `ui/settings/SettingsPanel.kt`. The debug controls that previously occupied the centre of the main screen (App Density, Rotation, DASH Scale, Splash Screen, Launcher, Exit) now live in a full-screen scrollable panel opened only from the bar's settings button. This is the intended model: the settings button is the one route into settings
- New System Bar settings section — position toggle (TOP/BOTTOM), height −/+ (40–120dp in 4dp steps), and a "Reset bar layout" button guarded by a confirmation dialog that returns the bar to its default (bottom, 56dp, alerts + settings)
- Not-default-launcher banner and diagnostic overlay now position themselves opposite the bar so they never collide with it when the bar is moved to the top

**Regressions:**
- None observed in build. On-device verification pending (see Outstanding)

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Scale/height conflict in the bar — DASH Scale multiplier applied to bar height alongside the dp control, giving two controls that both affect bar size → 1.3.2
- Element percentage-of-bar-height sizing, size variants (S/M/L), and soft-limit amber warnings → 1.3.4
- Zone splitting (up to three), inter-element snap packing, and the Spacer element → 1.3.5
- Drag-and-drop edit mode (long-press pickup, snap guidelines, draggable zone dividers) → 1.3.6
- Theme token system — named colour tokens (barBackground, barAccent, barText) as the single source of truth for system bar and element colours; prerequisite for settings panel visual identity inheritance in 1.5.x → 1.3.3
- On-device confirmation on the Pixel 8 / tablet: bar renders, settings button opens panel, position and height persist across an app kill, reset works

**Notes:**
- `kotlinx.serialization` added (plugin + `kotlinx-serialization-json` 1.7.3) — first use of JSON persistence in DASH. Flat preference keys don't map cleanly to a nested bar config, so JSON-in-DataStore is the right tool here; the existing flat keys (density, scale, splash, etc.) are untouched
- Version code bumped to 3, versionName to 1.3.1. The build file had been sitting at 1.2.0/2, one behind the 1.2.1 changelog entry — now reconciled
- Bar element rendering currently uses a single full-width zone with anchor-based placement (left/centre/right). The `SystemBar` composable already iterates zones with weighted widths, so multi-zone in 1.3.3 is an extension rather than a rewrite

---

## Version 1.2.1

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Splash screen now triggers on screen wake as well as cold boot — when the tablet wakes from sleep and DASH is the default launcher, the splash appears on top of DASH after the lock screen is dismissed
- `pendingWakeSplash` flag added to MainActivity — a dynamic `BroadcastReceiver` for `ACTION_SCREEN_ON` sets the flag when the screen wakes (conditional on DASH being the default launcher). The flag is consumed in `ON_RESUME`, which triggers the splash at the point DASH actually becomes visible rather than when the screen first turns on. This ensures the 2.5s timer starts after the lock screen is dismissed, not before
- Receiver registered with `ContextCompat.registerReceiver` and `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` — correct API 33+ handling. `ACTION_SCREEN_ON` cannot be registered in the manifest; dynamic registration is required

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- The flag approach (rather than directly setting `showSplash = true` from the receiver) is necessary because the lock screen sits between `ACTION_SCREEN_ON` and DASH becoming visible. Triggering the splash directly from the receiver starts the 2.5s timer while the lock screen is still showing — by the time the user unlocks, the splash has already auto-dismissed

---

## Version 1.2.0

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Launcher manifest declaration — HOME and DEFAULT_HOME intent filters added to MainActivity. `android:launchMode="singleTask"` and `android:stateNotNeeded="true"` added — standard launcher attributes preventing multiple instances and allowing Android to safely kill launcher state
- BootReceiver — `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission and `launcher/BootReceiver.kt` registered in manifest. Receives `BOOT_COMPLETED` and launches MainActivity. Foundation for 1.4.x startup reconciliation
- Default launcher prompt — on every `ON_RESUME`, checks whether DASH is the default home app. If not, a purple banner is shown across the top of the screen; tapping it opens the system launcher-selection dialog (API 29+: `RoleManager.createRequestRoleIntent(ROLE_HOME)` — shows a proper "make DASH your home app?" system prompt; API 24–28: opens `Settings.ACTION_HOME_SETTINGS`). Banner disappears automatically once DASH is set as default
- Change launcher escape button — "CHANGE LAUNCHER →" button permanently available in debug settings. Opens `Settings.ACTION_HOME_SETTINGS` (falls back to `Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_DEFAULT_APPS_SETTINGS`). Allows switching away from DASH on development hardware without needing ADB
- Splash screen — full-screen overlay shown on cold boot (`savedInstanceState == null`). Two modes: COLOUR (solid fill, three presets: Black, DASH Navy, Dark Slate) and IMAGE (user-selected via system photo picker, URI persisted with `takePersistableUriPermission`). Auto-dismisses after 2.5 seconds with 400ms fade-out; tap also dismisses. "PREVIEW SPLASH" button in debug UI allows testing without rebooting. Image loading uses `ContentResolver` + `BitmapFactory` — no additional dependencies required
- Navigation bar suppression — carried forward unchanged from 1.1.4. `hideSystemBars()` hides both status bar and navigation bar via `WindowInsetsControllerCompat`; `BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE` provides the transient fallback. Reapplied on every `onWindowFocusChanged`. Confirmed correct behaviour as a launcher

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- Ignition-driven screen wake/sleep behaviour deliberately deferred — depends on 1.4.x transport layer's system message parsing (`SYSTEM:ignition:on` / `SYSTEM:ignition:off`). Standard Android screen behaviour is fully adequate at this stage: DASH is the home app, so it is what the user sees when the screen wakes. No additional work is needed or appropriate here
- The `CHANGE LAUNCHER →` button is for development use on the Pixel 8. It will remain in whatever settings panel replaces the current debug UI in 1.6.x
- Version code bumped to 2 alongside 1.2.0

---

## Version 1.1.1

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Full Android project created from scratch — Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, minSdk 24, package com.dash.android
- App density preset system — Compact (160dpi), Normal (240dpi), Comfortable (320dpi), Large (480dpi) — wired to Android system density via IWindowManager reflection. Requires WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission granted once via ADB during development; production system app gets it natively
- DASH UI scale — fluid +/- system in 0.1x increments (0.5x–2.0x, default 1.0x) — drives DASH chrome size independently of system density
- Placeholder system bar — a horizontal strip at the bottom of the screen whose height responds to DASH scale, proving the scale system works
- Diagnostic overlay — top-left corner readout showing screen resolution, native DPI, selected density preset, and current scale value
- Exit button — resets system density to device default before closing, returning the phone to its normal state
- DASH density isolation — attachBaseContext override using DENSITY_DEVICE_STABLE ensures DASH chrome is immune to system density changes
- DataStore preference persistence — density preset and scale value survive app restarts
- interface.md updated — DASH UI scale changed from named presets to fluid stepwise system to match the actual design intent

**Regressions:**
- None at this stage — first implementation

**Fixes:**
- None required

**Outstanding:**
- Density preset system not functioning on physical hardware (Pixel 8) — buttons have no visible effect despite WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS being granted via ADB. Root cause unknown at close of this version — carries forward to 1.1.2
- Scale independence verification pending — confirming that DASH scale changes do not affect third party apps

**Notes:**
- The ADB permission grant (`adb shell pm grant com.dash.android android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`) is a one-time development setup step. Without it the density buttons have no effect — no crash, just silently no-ops
- System density persists while DASH is in the background by design — this is what makes the Spotify test possible
- DASH UI scale uses stepwise +/- rather than named presets — this was clarified with Roger during this session and interface.md was updated accordingly
- The gradlew wrapper was borrowed from a sibling project (AE2_infinitequantumstorage) rather than generated by Android Studio, since no Android Studio new-project wizard was used

---

## Version 1.1.2

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- Rotation controls added to test environment — AUTO, PORTRAIT, and LANDSCAPE buttons
- AUTO mode uses sensor-driven rotation (default on first launch)
- PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE buttons lock orientation and disable auto-rotate
- Selection persists via DataStore — rotation state survives app restarts
- Manifest screen orientation constraint removed — orientation now controlled entirely in code via `requestedOrientation`

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- Density preset system still not functioning on physical hardware — carries forward to 1.1.3

**Notes:**
- `LaunchedEffect(autoRotate, lockedOrientation)` in MainScreen applies orientation changes reactively as prefs change — no activity restart required

---

## Version 1.1.3

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- App Density capability check — on startup, DASH attempts the density-change operation and catches any failure (reflection failure, security exception, permission denial, or anything else). If the probe fails for any reason, the App Density section is greyed out with the message: "App density requires elevated system permissions not available on this installation."
- If the probe succeeds the setting works as originally designed — buttons are shown and functional

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- App Density previously swallowed all exceptions silently, giving no feedback when the operation failed. The capability check surfaces this correctly

**Outstanding:**
- None for 1.1.x — density and scale foundation is complete. App Density confirmed unavailable on Pixel 8 (capability check working correctly). Full verification of App Density deferred to a board where DASH runs as a system app and the call path is natively available

**Notes:**
- DASH UI Scale (the +/− buttons) works correctly on the Pixel 8 — this is DASH's own internal scaling and requires no system permissions
- App Density (system-wide DPI) requires IWindowManager access that Android's hidden API restrictions block for non-system apps on recent Android versions. The capability check correctly identifies this regardless of the specific restriction — the same check will pass on the Orange Pi when DASH is installed as a system app
- The probe sets density to `DENSITY_DEVICE_STABLE` (the device's native DPI), which is visually a no-op but exercises the full reflection call path

---

## Version 1.1.4

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- System bars (status bar and navigation bar) hidden on launch — DASH occupies the full screen
- `onWindowFocusChanged` override reapplies the hide whenever the window regains focus — notifications and dialogs can temporarily restore bars, but DASH reclaims full screen when it returns to the foreground
- Swipe from edge temporarily reveals bars then auto-hides (`BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE`) — keeps back gesture accessible during development without permanently surfacing the bars

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- Implemented via `WindowInsetsControllerCompat` — handles API differences between Android 7 (minSdk 24) and current versions transparently

---

## Version 1.1.5

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- App Density UI is capability-conditional. On startup, DASH probes `setForcedDisplayDensityForUser()` via `checkCapability()`. Two exclusive branches result:
  - **System app path** (probe succeeds — Orange Pi production): DASH shows its own native preset buttons (Compact / Normal / Comfortable / Large) that apply density directly via IWindowManager. No external navigation required
  - **Consumer device path** (probe fails — Pixel 8, any sideloaded build): DASH reads the current system density freely from `Settings.Global display_density_forced` (no permissions needed) and shows a button that opens Android's Display size and text settings screen directly. The current density label refreshes on every `ON_RESUME` so it updates immediately when the user returns from Android settings
- Deep link targets `Settings$TextReadingPreferenceActivity` (the Display size and text screen) directly on AOSP/Pixel devices, with a silent fallback to `Settings.ACTION_DISPLAY_SETTINGS` on devices where that component doesn't exist
- DensityManager gains `readCurrentSystemDpi()`, `tryWriteSystemDpi()`, and `formatDpi()` — IWindowManager reflection methods retained intact for the system app path

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- None

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- The two paths are mutually exclusive — system privileges mean DASH controls density natively; no privileges mean DASH defers to Android settings. No hybrid or intermediate state is shown
- `display_density_forced` in Settings.Global is the exact key Android's own Display Size setting writes — reading it requires no permissions and is always accurate
- Shizuku is the next step for consumer-device density control — it grants IWindowManager access via ADB without root, enabling the native preset path on sideloaded builds. Carries forward to v1.1.6
- The `tryWriteSystemDpi()` method (Settings.Global.putInt path) exists in DensityManager but is not exposed in the UI — it was a secondary investigation path that was not pursued. Can be removed in a future cleanup if Shizuku proves to be the right next step

---

## Version 1.1.6

**Status:** Complete

**Implemented:**
- `readCurrentSystemDpi()` rewritten to read from `context.applicationContext.resources.displayMetrics.densityDpi` instead of `Settings.Global.display_density_forced`
- `tryWriteSystemDpi()` removed — it was an unexposed investigation path from v1.1.5 with no UI entry point

**Regressions:**
- None

**Fixes:**
- Consumer path density label ("Current: X dpi") was stuck showing "Compact (160 dpi)" regardless of actual system density. Root cause: `display_density_forced` in Settings.Global had been written directly to 160 by the ADB test in v1.1.5, and Android's Display Size setting does not reliably update this key. Reading from `applicationContext.resources.displayMetrics.densityDpi` bypasses Settings.Global entirely and returns the actual live system density. The ON_RESUME observer was working correctly throughout — only the read source was wrong

**Outstanding:**
- None

**Notes:**
- `applicationContext` is not affected by DASH's activity-level `attachBaseContext` density isolation — it reflects real system density
- Shizuku is parked indefinitely. The consumer deep-link path is adequate for now. Shizuku may be revisited in version 2 if consumer density control becomes a priority
- 1.1.x is now complete
